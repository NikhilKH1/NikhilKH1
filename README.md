I'm Nikhil Kundalli Harish, a graduate student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with a background in software engineering and cloud infrastructure. I’m passionate about building reliable backend systems, automating development workflows, and applying AI to solve meaningful problems.

My experience spans across full-time engineering roles at Accenture and Alcon, where I worked on microservices, CI/CD automation, and containerized deployments using tools like Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

I’ve also led projects involving machine learning and NLP — including a cloud-native document processing system using AWS Bedrock and LLaMA 3, and a published research project on crop recommendation using SVMs.

Currently, I’m focused on distributed systems, performance optimization, and combining AI with scalable backend infrastructure. My work reflects a strong foundation in system design, clean code practices, and collaborative engineering.
