# Hi, I’m Nikhil Kundalli Harish 

**Software Engineer | MSCS @ Northeastern University | Cloud-Native, DevOps & AI/ML Engineer**

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I am a **results-driven software engineer** with **4+ years of industry experience** building **full-stack systems**, **cloud-native platforms**, and **ML-enabled applications** across **AWS and Azure**.  
I am currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University (Boston)**, with a focus on **AI/ML systems, distributed systems, and DevOps/MLOps**.

Previously, I worked at **Alcon R&D** and **Accenture**, where I:
- Built and scaled **production-grade microservices**
- Automated **CI/CD and cloud infrastructure**
- Improved **system reliability, security, and release velocity**

⚡ **Fun fact:** I enjoy blending **AI with DevOps** — recently building an **AI-powered RAG Document Processor** using **AWS Bedrock + LLaMA 3**, deployed via **serverless and Kubernetes-based workflows**.

## 🧠 AI / Machine Learning  

- Built **ML pipelines** for classification and regression problems using **Scikit-learn & PyTorch**
- Designed **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems** using **LLMs, vector databases, and LangChain-style workflows**
- Applied **feature engineering, model evaluation, and error analysis** for real-world datasets
- Integrated **ML models into production systems** with REST APIs and cloud infrastructure
- Experience with **MLOps concepts**: model versioning, reproducibility, and automated deployment
