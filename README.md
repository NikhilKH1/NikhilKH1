Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nikhil Kundalli Harish â€” a backend and cloud engineer pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University (2025â€“2026). I have 4+ years of industry experience building scalable microservices, automating CI/CD workflows, and deploying distributed systems using Java, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

### ðŸš€ What I Do
- Build fault-tolerant backend systems using Java Spring Boot & RESTful APIs
- Design and deploy cloud-native applications using AWS Lambda, Terraform, and Docker
- Apply AI/ML tools like AWS Bedrock & Scikit-learn to real-world problems (NLP, classification, RAG)
- Publish machine learning research (Springer, AIDE 2020)
- Containerize, test, and ship with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab, SonarQube)

### ðŸ“Œ Projects
- **ðŸ§  AI RAG Document Processor** â€” LLaMA 3 + AWS Bedrock for NLP Q&A over documents and URLs
- **ðŸ“… Calendar App** â€” Design-pattern-rich Java Swing GUI with 90% mutation coverage
- **ðŸŒ± Crop & Fertilizer Recommender** â€” ML model published by Springer; reduced waste by 20%
